## Dataset

The dataset used for training can be found at the following link: [Piano Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mudassar93/data_piano).

To load this dataset into your project, utilize the `datasets` library from Hugging Face. The following code snippet demonstrates how to do so:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("mudassar93/data_piano")
```

Ensure that you have the `datasets` library installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install datasets
```

## Fine-tuned Model

The fine-tuned model, is available here: [llama2-chat-piano on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mudassar93/llama2-chat-piano).

To use this model in your application, you'll need the `transformers` library. Below is the code to load the tokenizer and model:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mudassar93/llama2-chat-piano")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mudassar93/llama2-chat-piano")
```

If the `transformers` library is not already installed, you can install it using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

# Fine-Tuning Llama 2 with LoRA and QLoRA

This README summarizes the process of fine-tuning the Llama 2 model for a music-related task, leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for efficiency.

## Process Overview

1. **Library Installation**: Install all necessary libraries, including `transformers`, `datasets`, `accelerate`, `peft`, `trl`, and `bitsandbytes`.

2. **Environment Setup**: Configure your environment with the necessary Hugging Face token for access to datasets and models.

3. **Library Import**: Import required Python libraries for model fine-tuning and manipulation.

4. **Fine-Tuning Techniques**:
   - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Train the model on a dataset of instructions and responses.
   - **LoRA**: Introduce adapters in certain layers to train only a fraction of the model's weights, reducing computational costs.
   - **QLoRA**: Employ quantization in conjunction with LoRA, further reducing memory requirements by using 4-bit precision for the model's weights.

5. **Dataset Preparation**: Load the music dataset from Hugging Face and preprocess it for training.

6. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Load the base Llama 2 model.
   - Apply the chosen fine-tuning technique (LoRA/QLoRA).
   - Train the model using the prepared dataset.

7. **Evaluation and Application**: Test the fine-tuned model's performance on music-related tasks and integrate it into your application.

8. **Model and Tokenizer Pushing**: Upload the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access and sharing.

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to fine-tuning Llama 2 using advanced techniques like LoRA and QLoRA, tailored for tasks in the music domain.
